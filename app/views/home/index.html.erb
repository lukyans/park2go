  I drive to the city 3–4 times a week for work… It is hard
  <ul>
    <li>Forget to move your car during sweeping time and you get $45 ticket, <br>
    <li>Its even more painful when you go around for 30 minutes and still can't<br>
      find any, and end up parking at a garage</li>
    <li> On an average day, I’ll go around for 15 to 30 minutes,<br>
        even then, it might be an alternate side parking - meaning <br>
        a side of the street would prohibit parking from 9:30 to 11am</li></h4>
